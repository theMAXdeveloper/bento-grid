- Mobile-first workflow
- Tablet and Desktop breakpoints

### What I learned

This is the first practice project I have completed outside of my web-developer bootcamp.

I decided on the bento-grid because I knew it would be a challenge to my flexbox knowledge. 

I do not know CSS grid at this time which I belive this project was meant to be completed with. However, I was able to make the site with only flexbox. 

Before the project completion, I knew I would need to dive deeper into the flexbox concepts. My knowledge was pretty weak to start. However, I used flexbox games, articles, and blog posts to make more sense of the concepts.

The main takeaway from this project, was seperating and grouping the sections together, nesting smaller sections into larger sections. Each large section contained smaller sections that followed flexbox flow to create the desired layout. 

Being able to identify the correct section groupings and utilizing flexbox in each of those sections was a breakthrough in my deeper understanding of flexbox as a whole.   

By the end of the project, I feel more comfortable with flexbox, but still feel that there is room for more understanding. 

### Continued development

Continuing into the future, I would like to continue practicing flexbox until I can say with confidence that I understand it fully. 

I also would like to streamline/refactor code better in future projects. I believe my code for this project was decently clean, however I'm sure there is room for improvement that I can't see yet with my current knowledge.  

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me visualize the flexbox concepts better.

- [Resource 2](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the nuances of flexbox. I took a few hours of time during the project to read and take notes.

- [Resource 3](https://codepen.io/enxaneta/full/adLPwv/) - Another great flexbox concept visualizer.
